          title: "Avoid Smoking",
          text: "Avoid smoking whenever possible, as it remains the primary cause of chronic lung conditions such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and lung cancer—responsible for nearly 90% of lung cancer deaths. Even exposure to secondhand smoke can increase the risk of respiratory infections and asthma flare-ups, especially in children and older adults.",

        {
          title: "Exercise Regularly",
          text: "Engaging in regular physical activity, such as brisk walking, swimming, or cycling, helps increase lung capacity, improves circulation, and supports cardiovascular health. Aerobic exercise, in particular, encourages your lungs to work more efficiently over time, and studies show that just 30 minutes of moderate exercise five days a week can reduce your risk of chronic disease.",

        {
          title: "Avoid Air Pollution",
          text: "Keep track of local air quality indexes—especially if you live in urban or industrial regions—since high levels of air pollution, like particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone, and nitrogen dioxide, can trigger respiratory symptoms and worsen existing conditions such as asthma. On days when air quality is poor, it's safer to stay indoors, use air purifiers if available, and avoid heavy outdoor exertion.",

        {
          title: "Have a healthy diet",
          text: "A balanced diet rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and omega-3 fatty acids can support lung function and reduce inflammation. Foods like leafy greens, berries, fatty fish, and nuts are not only good for your lungs but can also help protect against chronic illnesses. Some studies have even linked high-fiber diets to better lung health and lower risks of respiratory disease.",

        },
        {
          title: "Drink Water",
          text: "Drinking plenty of water throughout the day helps maintain the thin, flowing consistency of mucous, which allows your respiratory system to trap and expel irritants like dust, bacteria, and allergens more effectively. Dehydration, on the other hand, can lead to thicker secretions, making breathing more difficult—especially for individuals with conditions like bronchitis or asthma.",
