        <h1>Anatomy of Our Lungs</h1>
        <p>The lungs are a pair of spongy, air-filled organs located in the chest cavity, protected by the rib cage. Each lung is divided into sections called lobes — the right lung has three lobes (superior, middle, and inferior), while the left lung has two (superior and inferior) to make space for the heart. The lungs are connected to the trachea via the bronchi, which branch into smaller bronchioles and end in tiny air sacs called alveoli, where gas exchange occurs. Surrounding the lungs is a thin membrane called the pleura, which helps reduce friction during breathing. The lungs work closely with the diaphragm and intercostal muscles to draw air in and out, allowing oxygen to enter the bloodstream and carbon dioxide to be expelled.</p>

        <h1>Why is learning about our lungs important?</h1>
        <p>Understanding the anatomy of our lungs is essential because it helps us appreciate how our bodies take in oxygen and remove carbon dioxide — a vital process for survival. By learning how the lungs function and how air moves through the respiratory system, we can better recognize the signs of respiratory illnesses like asthma, bronchitis, or pneumonia. This knowledge also helps us make informed decisions about our health, such as avoiding smoking or environmental pollutants that can damage lung tissue. Whether you're a student, healthcare worker, or simply curious about your body, knowing how your lungs work empowers you to take better care of them.</p>
